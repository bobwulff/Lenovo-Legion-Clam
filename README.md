It is HIGHLY recommended to print this yourself. If that is not possible, a PLA 3D print can be purchased [via PCBway ](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Lenovo_Legion_Clam_b2800a93.html)

When printing, make sure the very top line (seen in red below) is printed in TPU and not PLA to ensure a soft gentle close. This is likely NOT possible when ordering from PCBway (in that case, supliment with electrical tape or another rubber stopper).

It is also recommended to print the very bottom at a very high infill so it's much heavier.
